# DFA-Minimization
The DFA Minimization System is a Python-based tool designed to optimize Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) by reducing the number of states using efficient partitioning techniques. It allows users to input states, symbols, transitions, initial and final states, and then generates a minimized DFA along with its transition table. Additionally, it visualizes the minimized DFA as a state diagram using Graphviz, making it easier to understand the state transitions. The project ensures user-friendly interaction, accurate minimization, and clear visual outputs. To run the project, simply install Python and Graphviz, provide the required inputs, and the minimized DFA along with its visual representation will be generated seamlessly.
