# DFA-Minimization
This project implements a DFA Minimization System using Python. It reduces the number of states in a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) by applying partitioning techniques, ensuring efficient state transitions. The system features user input handling, transition table generation, and visualizes the minimized DFA using Graphviz.
